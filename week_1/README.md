# Week 1: Python Basic and Inroduction of pandas and numpy

Welcome to the beginning of your data science journey! Regardless of your background, this is your first step toward transitioning into the field of data science. <br>

This course is part of a 15-week structured plan designed to help individuals from non-tech backgrounds transition smoothly into data science. In Week 1, we will cover the fundamentals of Python, including variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, and key data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. We’ll also introduce two essential Python libraries for data science: pandas and NumPy. These libraries form the backbone of data manipulation and numerical computing, which are critical skills for data science.<br>

<br> Additionally, we’ll guide you through using Jupyter Notebook, a powerful tool for writing and running Python code interactively, making it perfect for hands-on learning.

### 1. Installation of Anaconda
Anaconda is a widely used distribution of Python, tailored for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. It simplifies the process of installing necessary packages and managing environments. Anaconda comes with pre-installed tools like Jupyter Notebook, which we’ll be using for interactive coding exercises. <br>
<br>Here are steps for installing Anaconda:<br>
1. Visit the official Anaconda website (https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) and download the version that matches your operating system;
2. Follow the installation prompts to complete the setup using default settings;
3. Once installed, launch Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda Navigator or via the command line by typing jupyter notebook. <br>

### 2. Python Basics & Data Structures
In Week 1, we’ll also revisit the basic Python concepts that I previously covered in the Python for Absolute Beginners (https://github.com/fyuan1014/Pyhton4AbsoluteBeginners_Tutorial) repository. This tutorial covers core Python topics such as: Variables and Data Types, Control Flow (if-else statements, loops), Functions and Data Structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets).

<br>For your convenience to play with the code, I have adjusted that into a Jupyter Notebook file in this folder (i.e., week_1).

### 3. Introduction of pandas and NumPy
Both pandas and NumPy are indispensable for data science, especially for individuals transitioning from non-tech backgrounds. These libraries form the foundation for data manipulation and numerical analysis and serve as the building blocks for advanced data science tools like scikit-learn for machine learning, Matplotlib for visualization, and TensorFlow for deep learning. Mastery of these two libraries will empower you to tackle more complex data science tasks in the future.<br>
#### 3.1 pandas
pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. It simplifies handling structured data (e.g., tables or Excel-like data) through its intuitive Series and DataFrame objects. Whether you're dealing with missing data, large datasets, or complex transformations, pandas makes these tasks far easier. In this notebook, you’ll learn how to:<br>
1. Install pandas (!pip install pandas) in your Jupyter Notebook (After the installation, you may need to restart your kernel to use it)
2. Import pandas (import pandas as pd)
3. Work with Series and DataFrames for organizing and analyzing data
4. Perform basic operations such as filtering, selecting, and summarizing data with DataFrame object

#### 3.2 NumPy
NumPy is the core library for efficient numerical computing in Python. It provides fast and flexible arrays that are essential for many data science tasks, including machine learning and AI. NumPy enables operations on arrays without the need for loops, making it particularly useful for processing large datasets such as training a depp neural network. You’ll learn how to:<br>
1. Install NumPy (!pip install numpy)
2. Import NumPy (import numpy as np)
3. Create and manipulate 1D and 2D arrays
4. Perform mathematical operations on arrays, including array slicing, reshaping, and element-wise operations<br>

<br>By the end of Week 1, you’ll have a strong understanding of Python basics and be equipped to manipulate data efficiently using pandas and NumPy. Let’s dive in and get started!
